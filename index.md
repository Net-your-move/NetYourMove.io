Our company looks to manufacture custom 3D printed bandages to replace heavy and bulky cast bandages. 3D printing technology has revolutionized the entire market, offering a very quick, simple and inexpensive way to make 3d models a reality. This new technology is perfect for our business, since we are not looking to mass produce thousands of products, but instead, create a bandage adapted to the customer's necesities and requirements.
